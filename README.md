# Banking System

## Introduction
This is a simple C-based code (My first C project) which mocks a simple bank.
The user has to login into an existing account or create one.
Then if the login is successful, the user can either deposit, withdraw of check the balance in that account.

*NOTE*: This project is run on the terminal and has no user interface.
